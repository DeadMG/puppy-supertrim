search-text=Choose a surface to supertrim:
search-warning=Supertrimming removes any chunk on the surface with no player entities on it. This should not be used on surfaces with special non-player entities like SE vaults.\nSupertrimming is done over time. Additionally, Supertrimming may remove player entities in weird cases with chunk boundaries.\nLike all trim operations, Supertrimmed chunks may contain previously-removed map-generated objects like biters or ores if the player regenerates them.\nSupertrimming many surfaces at once may lag the game temporarily.
